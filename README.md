TASK 1

CALCULATOR APP


● Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.

● Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice.

● Perform the calculation and display the result.

                             ----------------------------------------------
                             
                             
TASK 2

PASSWORD GENERATOR


● A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords
for users. This project aims to create a password generator application using
Python, allowing user to specify the length and complexity of the password.

● User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.

● Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to generate a
password of the specified length.

● Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.

                            -----------------------------------------------
                            

TASK 3

ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS GAME


● User Input: Prompt users to select rock, paper, or scissors.

● Computer Selection: Randomly generate the computer's choice.

● Game Logic: Determine the winner based on user and computer selections. Rock
beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.

● Display Result: Present user and computer choices. Display outcomes: win, lose, or
tie.

● Score Tracking (Optional): Record user and computer scores for multiple rounds.

● Play Again: Ask if users want another round.

● User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and
feedback.

                          -------------------------------------------------
                          

TASK 4
HANGMAN GAME


● Word List: Create a list of words for the game.

● Random Word: Select a random word from the list.

● Initial Display: Show empty hangman figure and underscores for unguessed
letters.

● User Input: Prompt the user for a letter guess.

● Check Letter: Validate the guess and check if it's in the word.

● Update State: Reveal correctly guessed letters in the word.

● Hangman Display: Display hangman figure for incorrect guesses.

● Win/Loss Check: Determine win or loss conditions.

● Play Again: Ask if the player wants to play another round.

● User Interface: Design a clear interface showing hangman figure, word state, and
feedback


                               ------------------------------------------
                               

TASK 5

DICE ROLLING SIMULATOR


● Create a simple Python program that simulates rolling dice. Users can specify the
number of sides on the dice and the number of rolls.

● The program generates random numbers for each roll and displays the results.

● It's a quick and fun way to emulate the experience of rolling dice, commonly used
in board games or tabletop role-playing games.

● The simulator allows users to explore the outcomes of dice rolls without the
physical dice.

                             ----------------------------------------------


TASK 6

COUNTDOWN TIMER


● The Countdown Timer Python project is designed to create a user-friendly timer
application that counts down from a specified time.

● Utilizing libraries like tkinter for the graphical user interface and time for
time-related functions, this project enhances skills in event handling and time
management. Users can set custom countdown durations, making it a versatile
tool for tasks like cooking, productivity sprints, or workout sessions.

● This project showcases practical application of Python in creating interactive and
functional desktop tools.
